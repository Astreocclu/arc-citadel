Generate a hex region for a fantasy strategy game called Arc Citadel.

## Region Details
- Name: {region_name}
- Theme: {region_theme}
- Number of hexes: {hex_count}

## Output Format
Return a JSON object matching this exact structure:

```json
{{
  "name": "Region Name",
  "description": "A 1-2 sentence description of the region's atmosphere and history.",
  "theme": "The overall theme in a few words",
  "hexes": [
    {{
      "q": 0,
      "r": 0,
      "terrain": "plains",
      "elevation": 0.3,
      "moisture": 0.5,
      "resources": [
        {{"type": "fertile_soil", "abundance": 0.7}}
      ],
      "features": [
        {{"type": "spring", "description": "A clear spring bubbles from ancient stones."}}
      ],
      "traversable": true,
      "defense_bonus": 0.1
    }}
  ]
}}
```

## Terrain Types
plains, forest, hills, mountains, water, swamp, desert, tundra

## Resource Types
iron, copper, gold, silver, coal, gems, timber, stone, fertile_soil, fish, game, herbs

## Feature Types
ruins, cave, spring, ancient_tree, standing_stones, ravine, clearing, overlook

## Constraints
1. Elevation: 0.0-1.0 (mountains >= 0.7, water <= 0.3)
2. Moisture: 0.0-1.0 (desert <= 0.2, swamp >= 0.7)
3. Max 3 resources per hex
4. Max 2 features per hex
5. Defense bonus: 0.0-0.5 (higher for hills, forests, mountains)
6. Use axial coordinates (q, r) - hexes should be adjacent/connected
7. Water is typically not traversable by land units

## Guidelines
- Create variety within the theme
- Resources should make sense for terrain (fish in water, timber in forest)
- Features add flavor - use sparingly but meaningfully
- Connected hexes should have plausible terrain transitions
- High elevation areas near mountains, low near water
- Consider strategic value when placing defense bonuses

Generate {hex_count} hexes forming a coherent, connected region.
