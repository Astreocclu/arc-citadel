# Geometry Skeleton Generation (Stage 1 - Reasoner)

Generate a SKELETON for tactical game geometry. Output component descriptions with placeholder geometry.
DO NOT generate actual coordinates - just describe what each component should be.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

```json
{
  "wall_segments": [
    {
      "variant_id": "stone_wall_001",
      "display_name": "Standard Stone Wall",
      "description": "Basic defensive wall, 3m long, 2m high, rectangular footprint",
      "intended_purpose": "Basic cover for infantry",
      "geometry_placeholder": "FILL_RECTANGLE_3x0.5"
    }
  ],
  "archer_towers": [
    {
      "variant_id": "watchtower_001",
      "display_name": "Corner Watchtower",
      "description": "Square tower, 6m base, 12m height, 360-degree firing arc",
      "intended_purpose": "Full coverage observation point",
      "geometry_placeholder": "FILL_SQUARE_6x6"
    }
  ],
  "trenches": [...],
  "gates": [...],
  "street_segments": [...]
}
```

## REQUIREMENTS

Generate exactly:
- 10 wall_segment variants (mix of lengths 2-10m, heights 1.5-5m)
- 10 archer_tower variants (mix of shapes, heights 8-15m, various firing arcs)
- 10 trench_segment variants (depths 1-3m, widths 1-4m)
- 10 gate variants (widths 3-8m for different unit types)
- 10 street_segment variants (widths 2-10m for foot/cart/cavalry)

For each component include:
- variant_id: unique snake_case identifier
- display_name: human readable name
- description: physical description with key dimensions
- intended_purpose: tactical/gameplay purpose
- geometry_placeholder: hint for Stage 2 (FILL_SHAPE_dimensions)

DO NOT include actual vertex coordinates. Stage 2 will generate those.
